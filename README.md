> A personal collection of prompts for language models.


[Nooprompter](https://civvic.github.io/nooprompter/) is a personal repository of prompts to explore, steer, and refine the behavior of language models: part archive, part reference, part playground, part workshop. What begins here as a simple collection of prompt experiments may grow into a toolkit — including notebooks, code snippets, and lightweight apps — all aimed at shaping context and taming model outputs. Think of it as a lab notebook for the art and science of prompting.
